Example Playbook
----------------
Install the role via:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install azure.aks
```

Use the role in the playbook to create the most default AKS:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
      - include_role:
           name: azure.aks
        vars:
           name: akscluster
           resource_group: aksroletest
```
Create an AKS with monitoring:

```yml
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
      - include_role:
           name: azure.aks
        vars:
           monitoring: yes
           name: akscluster
           resource_group: aksroletest
```
